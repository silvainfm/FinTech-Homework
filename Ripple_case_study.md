# Ripple Case study 

## Overview and Origin

* Ripple (before OpenCoin)
* Incorporated in 2013

The founders of the company are Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen. 

The idea came about from Ryan Fugger who wanted to create a decentralized monetary system in 2004. This idea was then expanded into a digital currency 
thanks to McCaleb and Larsen, after the invention of Bitcoin sparked their interest in cryptocurrency. 

The company is privately funded. It is also funded through the sale of the digital currency it is trying to promote - XRP. It sells XRP to the banks and different financial institutions who will use the currency to cross-border payments and other payments. 


## Business Activities:

The company is providing real-time payments and settlements, solving scalability, bringing down the costs of global transactions and bring sustainability to the payments industry. It aims to improve financial institutions by providing them with the necessary tools for faster and cheaper payments. 

The company's intended customers are different global and local financial institutions who process payments. This includes banks and credit card companies.
The market size of the global banking industry is approximately $7.9 trillion. 
They offer a digital currency that they are continuously improving and building projects on to accelerate payments, and integrate with existing banking infrastructure. This is allowed thanks to the open source code of the protocol. 

Moreover they offer 2 other protocols:
* PayID - an open payment network to send money between users.
* Interledger - an open payment protocol to send payments across different ledgers. 

They are currently using SQL, NoSQL, Java, Python, Maven Archetype, Git, GitLab, Kubernetes, AWS. 


## Landscape:

The company is definitely in the FinTech industry.

The major trend has been to partner with existing respected institutions to gain visibility and trust. 
Innovations in the particular space of this company have included blockchain, DeFi, smart contracts. 

Other major similar companies include Stellar, Swift, Chainlink and Square. 


## Results

So far, Ripple has partnered with many banks and financial instutions, who have been able to integrate the technology and use it for their customers, like Moneygram for example. 

Some core metrics to measure success can be the sale of XRP to partners, the number of partners, how many partners are actually using the technology not just testing it.
Based on these metrics the company is performing very well as it is adding partners every quarter. 

Since this company overlaps different domains, compared to other cryptocurrency companies it is performing very well, compared to its competitors such as Swift it is still a small fish. 


## Recommendations

I would advise them to offer a list of standardized KYC requirements that their partners could implement to shield themselves against money laundering, have better security, since most of their partners deal with global payments, and include that in the ledger offering. 

It would probably use some kind of current law tracking program, using APIs from official sources on KYC requirements (national governement or state governement websites) in the areas of the client. Specifically this software could be built-in the payments software, and use keywords to recognize which laws impact the client. 

They are appropriate as they could provide real-time info on changes needed to be made to the KYC requirements of the company's clients.
